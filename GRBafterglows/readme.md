## GRB Afterglows Metric

### Light Curve Modeling

- **Peak magnitude range**: −24 to −22  
- **Initial condition**: Light curve begins at peak (no chance of detecting the rise)  
- **Light curve model**:  
  `m(t) = m₀ + 2.5 × α × log₁₀(t / t₀)`  
  - Pre-jet break slope: α ≈ 1.5 (range: 0.5–1.7)  
  - **Jet break time**: Between 1 and 5 days  
  - **Post-jet break slope**: α = 10  
- **Filter treatment**: Light curve parameters between filters are currently uncorrelated

### Population Modeling

- **Volumetric rate**: `1e-8 Mpc⁻³ yr⁻¹`  
- **Distance range**: 10 to 1000 Mpc

### Detection Criteria

**Option A**  
- ≥2 detections in a single filter  
- ≥30 minutes apart  

**Option B**  
- ≥2 epochs total  
- Second epoch must have ≥2 filters  
- First epoch may be a non-detection  

**Additional constraint**  
- **Maximum time gap** between any pair of observations: 1 day
