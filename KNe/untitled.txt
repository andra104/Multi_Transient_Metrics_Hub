Based on the logic of the template and local_GRBafterglows_metric that I have attached, I now want to write a metric for Luminous Fast Blue Optical Transients (LFBOTs) with the following light curve details, rate of occurrence, Detection Criteria, and other details. 

Light curve details: 

    "LFBOT": {
        "riseRates": {'u': "-", 'g': (0.25, 2.5), 'r': (0.25, 2.5), 
                      'i': "-", 'z': "-", 'y': "-"},
        "fadeRates": {'u': "-", 'g': (0.15, 0.45), 'r': (0.15, 0.45), 
                      'i': "-", 'z': "-", 'y': "-"},
        "peakMagRange": {'u': "-", 'g': (-21.5, -20), 'r': (-21.5, -20), 
                         'i': "-", 'z': "-", 'y': "-"},
        "durationAtPeak": {'u': "-", 'g': "< 4", 'r': "< 4", 
                           'i': "-", 'z': "-", 'y': "-"},
        "timeAboveHalfMax":{'u': "-", 'g': "12", 'r': "12", 
                           'i': "-", 'z': "-", 'y': "-"},}

Rate of occurence: 0.3 − 420 × 10^−9 /Mpc^3/yr


Detection Criteria: 
We require detections in at least two epochs, with at least one epoch having detections in ≥ 2 filters to determine a color AND a reliable estimate of the host galaxy redshift. So this would be flagged as a rapidly rising and very blue, and very luminous transient.
 If the transient is not identified on the rise, then we require at least three epochs to get a sense for the duration above half-maximum light. We could then flag the transient on the basis of a duration under 9 days AND a high implied luminosity from the host-galaxy redshift.
 Detections must be separated by at least 30 minutes to remove moving objects. Detections have a maximum separation of ??? days to enable confirmation of sufficiently fast evolution.

Other Details: 

One example is AT2018cow (Prentice et al 2018, https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2018ApJ...865L...3P/abstract, Figure 2).  Initially was discovered at a peak of ATLAS c = 13.6 mag and declined at a rate of 0.2 mag/day over 2 weeks, with consistent blue colors (g – r ~ -0.5 mag).  This was exceptionally bright and nearby, so we expect most LFBOTs to appear dimmer.  Another example is AT2023fhn (Chrimes et al. 2024, https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2024MNRAS.527L..47C/abstract, Section 2.1 & Table 2).  Was discovered at r = 19.7 mag and briefly brightened by 0.5 magnitudes by a day later, then declined at a rate of 0.2 mag/day over ten days.	

You listed the requirements for detection, which is great - if there were more observations of the LFBOT than that, could we better characterize it? (we can have different criteria for “detection” and “characterization”, if so)	

At least with ZTF, we typically use optical surveys just for detection of possible LFBOT candidates.  Further characterization of a candidate, and determing whether it is an actual LFBOT, is typically done through follow-up observations, such as radio and X-ray follow-up and optical spectroscopy to determine the redshift.  Continued long-term observations would be very useful in showing the fading tail of an LFBOT’s light curve, but as of now, that would be just be a helpful bonus.

Right now the text states, "Detections must be separated by at least 30 minutes to remove moving objects. Detections have a maximum separation of ? days to enable confirmation of sufficiently fast evolution.” Let me know if you have a separation you want to use for that; otherwise we’ll just set the maximum at whenever it becomes dim enough to no longer be visible.

I changed this to 6 days to accurately observe a timescale above half-maximum of less than twelve days, as well as accounting for the fact that a typical 0.2 mag/day fade results in a two magnitude drop after 6 days.  This is mostly an informal benchmark based on examining current LFBOT light curves and estimating the minimum data we need to detect them as a candidate.
